# Why?

I wanted my [dotfiles][dotfiles] to have an install script that supported all the platforms I actively use (brew via macOS, APT on Ubuntu, Debian, and [Termux][termux] on Android).

So... literally because I'm lazy.

And I wanted a DRY(-er?) install script I guess.


# Supported Package Managers

* Homebrew (and Linuxbrew)
* APT (Debian and Debian-like distros)
* Sudo-less APT (Termux)

I'm also planning to include CentOS and [btw I use] Arch in future releases.

In the mean time, [tell me what _you_ want][issues]!

# Install

```
curl -o pak https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-ggs/pak/master/pak ; chmod +x pak
```

# Usage

* Print the current system's package manager

```
# macOS via Homebrew
$ pak brew
brew

# Ubuntu
$ pak
apt-get
```

* Print the install command for the system's package manager

```
# macOS via Homebrew
$ pak install
brew install

# Ubuntu
$ pak install
sudo apt-get install -y
```

* Install packages with the system's package manager

```
# macOS via Homebrew
$ pak install vim

# Limitations

This does not take into account differences in package names across the different package managers it supports. (e.g. `silversearcher-ag` on APT and `the_silver_searcher` on brew)
